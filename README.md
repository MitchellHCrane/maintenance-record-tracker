# Maintenance Record Tracker

Devmountain Capstone Project Proposal &amp; MVP

## Pitch/Idea:
Create a web application that allows users to track maintenance records/history of their vehicle(s) instead of manually searching through paper records  

## MVP:
* Users can add a vehicle
* Users can select vehicle to view/edit/add to maintenance history
* Users can upload an image to each vehicle profile
* Users can add in a maintenance record that includes date, miles/hrs, and service performed
* Users can edit past history records
* Users can login to view their garage

## Future Features:
* Users can have a choice of pre selected images to add to vehicle profile
* Users can add images to maintenance records (ex. Picture of air filter condition)
* Users can share maintenance record with anyone (link open to public)
* Users can add multiple vehicles or machines that they desire to track
